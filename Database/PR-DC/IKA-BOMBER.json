  "description": "The IKA-BOMBER military grade rotary wing drone was designed and manufactured by the PR-DC company in a hexacopter configuration. The construction of the aircraft is made of composite materials, primarily carbon fiber and epoxy resin, which enables a 30-minute flight with 20 kilograms of cargo, which is unique on the market. The flight can be fully autonomous and can carry 12 60mm aerial bombs (like Krušik M73) which can be accurately dropped one by one and neutralize different targets.",
