  "description": "The GANNET drone (codename RW-TARGET-150) is a low-cost, fully electric, vertical take-off and landing, rotary-wing quadcopter drone designed and produced by PR-DC. It features a very rigid all-aluminum airframe and single-button, maintenance-free operation. The aircraft's unique geometry enables high-speed flight untypical for multicopters of similar size. Flight can be programmed to be fully autonomous (including swarms), and the drone can be fitted with various equipment such as LED screens, a decoy flare launcher, various electromagnetic radiation sources, etc. The system includes a flight recorder for further data analysis.",
