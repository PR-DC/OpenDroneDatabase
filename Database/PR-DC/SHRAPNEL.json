  "description": "The SHRAPNEL drone is a fixed-wing loitering munition designed and produced by PR-DC with a unique high-performance box wing. The aircraft is made of composite materials, primarily of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers. It is armed with a 81 mm aerial bomb (e.g. Krušik M72), which is easily slided through the aircraft frame and fixed before launch. Flight can be programmed to be fully autonomous according to target coordinates, or manually guided using a camera.",
